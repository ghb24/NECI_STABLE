!TPREVAR is set to true when the precalc routines have yet to run.
        LOGICAL TPREVAR

!PRE_TAYLOG(1,precalc_vertex_level)='use' those sets of optimised parameters
!PRE_TAYLOG(2,...)=Does the 'c' (matrix element) parameter want to be optimised?
!PRE_TAYLOG(3,...)=Does the 'importance' parameter want to be optimised?
!PRE_TAYLOG(4,...)=Does the 'importance' parameter want to be used?
!PRE_TAYLOG(5,...)=Does the 'd' (inverse energy change) parameter want to be optimised?
!PRE_TAYLOG(6,...)=Does the 'd' parameter want to be used?
        LOGICAL PRE_TAYLOG(6,10)

!TLINEVAR/GRIDVAR will create a surface of expected variances for the vertex levels indicated for 1D/2D probability distributions respectivly
        LOGICAL TLINEVAR(2:10),TGRIDVAR(2:10)

!MEMSAV will hold the excitations for MC-Precalc in memory for that vertex level - memory/speed trade-off
        LOGICAL MEMSAV(2:10)

!PRE_TAY(1,...)=The method to use for the precalc at that vertex level
!PRE_TAY(2,...)=The number of cycles to use for MC-precalc optimisation at that level
!PRE_TAY(3,...)=The precalc vertex level
!PREIV_MAX = The largest vertex level to be optimised in precalc
        INTEGER PREIV_MAX,PRE_TAY(3,10)

!TRUECYCLES are the cycles needed in the main program to achieve an error specified by TOTALERROR
        INTEGER TRUECYCLES

!USEVAR indicates which precalc optimised values at each vertex level are to be used for each vertex level in the main program.
        INTEGER USEVAR(2:10,8)

!PRE_TAYREAL(1,...)= 'c epsilon' - if the difference between the optimised 'c' parameter and 0.D0 is less than this, then just set it to zero.
!PRE_TAYREAL(2,...) is the tolerance for convergence onto an optimised parameter in terms of the change in the brent algorithm for the parameter for each iteration.
!TOTALERROR is a specified desired error in the main program, from which the number of cycles needed will be approximated.
!PREWEIGHTEPS means a graph will be discarded in the MC-precalc if its weight is less than this
        REAL*8 PRE_TAYREAL(2,10),TOTALERROR,PREWEIGHTEPS

!GRID/LINEVARPAR gives the parameters for the search when TGRID/LINEVAR is set.
        REAL*8 GRIDVARPAR(2:10,6),LINEVARPAR(2:10,6)

!The following arrays are all used to hold data in the precalc variance calculations.
!NMEM is excitation generators(if they are saved)
!PGENLIST is a list of the PGens of the randomly generated graphs
!GRAPHPARAMS are the weightings that are used in the graph generations
!GRAPHS are the determinants in the graphs
!PVERTMEMS are pointers to the excitation generators
