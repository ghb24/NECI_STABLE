Fortran 2003 features
---------------------

1. Use ieee_arithmetic for isnan and get_nan.
2. Fortran function pointers rather than using c_ptrs from iso_c_binding.

Compiler bugs
-------------

1. Remove the pathscale hack in fcimc_wrapper.F90
2. gfortran has a bug sorting module locations. Changing to the -J rather than
   -M flag fixes this for versions .ge. 4.4, but breaks it otherwise. For these
   versions, it is necessary to manually link to the mpi.mod file for it to find it
   while retaining the path to put compiled .mod files.
   An alternative workaround is to manually add the MPI library path to the
   search path using -I.
3. PGI has issues with custom operators and public/private declarations in modules.
   If these go away, remove the comments from the relevant sections of util_mod.
4. gfortran throws a wobbly about labelling a past function as an operator unless
   the passed function is also called directly. See the workaround in
   lib/quicksort.F90.template
